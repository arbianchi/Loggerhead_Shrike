          Research and management needs for the Loggerhead Shrike depends upon the spatial scale of study.  Across the species’ range, research is still needed to understand the causes of the population declines, but, these may vary.  For example, the impact of pesticides and other contaminants is likely a greater concern in the areas in which such agricultural practices are common.

        <h2>Meet the Loggerhead Shrike</h2>
        <p>
          Shrikes (Laniidae) are a charismatic group of small to medium sized songbirds with habits and morphology that is similar to birds of prey (raptors).  Their Latin name, Lanius, means butcher and shrikes are often referred to as ‘butcher birds due to their habit of impaling prey on sharp thorns or in forks of small branches. Believed to have originated in Africa (Lefranc 1997), shrikes are found on all continents except Australia and South America. Many shrike species in Europe and North America have experienced drastic population declines, and the research of many biologists is focused on better understanding the biology of the species and conservation issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only two species of shrikes world-wide occur in North America:  Northern Shrike (Lanius excubitorides) and Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus).  They are most closely related to the ‘excubitor’ group of shrikes and together, form a superspecies with the Chinese Great Grey Shrike (Lanius sphenocercus).  Both species likely derived from shrikes in Siberia that colonized North America across the Bering Strait land birdge during the Pleistocene (Mayr 1946).  The relationship between the two North American shrike species is unclear.  It is possible that the Loggerhead Shrike originated independently from Asian shrikes, or could have derived from Nearctic Northern Shrikes by isolation south of glaciated regions during the Pleistocene or Pliocene.  The ecological relationship of Northern and Loggerhead Shrikes parallels that of the northern and southern species of Northern, or Great Grey, Shrike in the Palearctic (Panov 1995)
