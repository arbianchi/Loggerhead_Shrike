        <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            The Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) is one of two species of shrike that occur in North America and the only species of shrike world-wide that has an exclusively North American range.  The shrike is a robin-sized songbird with a raptor-like hooked bill, grey body with a black face-mask, and black wings with a prominent white wing patch.  Easily confused with the Northern Shrike (Lanius excubitor), the Loggerhead is smaller in size and its face mask extends across the base of the bill.  Sometimes called the "butcher bird", this predatory songbird has the unique habit of impaling its prey, mostly insects, but occasionally small vertebrates such as mice or snakes on twigs or thorns.

            Research and management needs for the Loggerhead Shrike depends upon the spatial scale of study.  Across the species’ range, research is still needed to understand the causes of the population declines, but, these may vary.  For example, the impact of pesticides and other contaminants is likely a greater concern in the areas in which such agricultural practices are common.

    <h2>Meet the Loggerhead Shrike</h2>
      <p>
        Shrikes (Laniidae) are a charismatic group of small to medium sized songbirds with habits and morphology that is similar to birds of prey (raptors).  Their Latin name, Lanius, means butcher and shrikes are often referred to as ‘butcher birds due to their habit of impaling prey on sharp thorns or in forks of small branches. Believed to have originated in Africa (Lefranc 1997), shrikes are found on all continents except Australia and South America. Many shrike species in Europe and North America have experienced drastic population declines, and the research of many biologists is focused on better understanding the biology of the species and conservation issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only two species of shrikes world-wide occur in North America:  Northern Shrike (Lanius excubitorides) and Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus).  They are most closely related to the ‘excubitor’ group of shrikes and together, form a superspecies with the Chinese Great Grey Shrike (Lanius sphenocercus).  Both species likely derived from shrikes in Siberia that colonized North America across the Bering Strait land birdge during the Pleistocene (Mayr 1946).  The relationship between the two North American shrike species is unclear.  It is possible that the Loggerhead Shrike originated independently from Asian shrikes, or could have derived from Nearctic Northern Shrikes by isolation south of glaciated regions during the Pleistocene or Pliocene.  The ecological relationship of Northern and Loggerhead Shrikes parallels that of the northern and southern species of Northern, or Great Grey, Shrike in the Palearctic (Panov 1995)

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>
      The Loggerhead Shrike utilizes grassland habitats that vary from shrub-steppe in the western United States to pastureland in the eastern Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec (Pruitt 2000).  Shrikes hunt by scanning for prey from perches in open short-grass areas, and they prefer a combination of pasture or short grassland with scattered low trees and shrubs.  But, suitable ‘habitat’ also includes rural residential development, light industrial and business parks, cemeteries and suburban parks.

      The Carden Plain is regarded as one of the strongholds of the Loggerhead Shrike in Ontario. In the mid-1970's, an estimated 30 pairs were present in the Carden area (Pittaway 1991).  During the first Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas (OBBA, 1981 – 1985), one 10 x 10 km square was estimated to have more than 10 breeding pairs.  Shrike numbers fell to a low of 4 known breeding pairs in the mid-1990s in the area.  Its presence was again confirmed during the second OBBA survey (2000 – 2005).  Ten to fourteen breeding pairs have been located annually in recent years.  The Carden Plain is well known as an Important Bird Area (IBA) for many grassland bird species.

    <h2>Conservation</h2>
    <p>
      My research is undertaken in collaboration with the Canadian Wildlife Service and other partners across North America.  The goal of our research is to compare Loggerhead Shrike populations from across Canada and the United States to examine migratory behaviour, identify key wintering areas and to understand the species’ population structure, including assessing age and sex biased dispersal and migration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also assist the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Team to answer conservation related questions that help guide recovery and management activities.  Work to date includes assessing and comparing historic and current genetic diversity of the captive population versus the wild population in Ontario; comparing genetic diversity estimates for the captive colony based on the ‘pedigree’ approach versus actual estimates of diversity using nuclear genetic markers; determining the need for augmentation of the captive population assure genetic viability; assessing if inbreeding depression is reducing viability of captive bred birds; and quantifying the genetically effective versus census population size of the wild isolated Ontario population with that of the relatively stable Colorado population.

    <h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
    <p>
      Report any sightings of Loggerhead Shrike in Ontario and Quebec, or shrikes with colour bands anywhere in North America to Wildlife Preservation Canada’s toll-free shrike line: 1-800-956-6608.  Be careful not to confuse Loggerhead and Northern Shrikes!  Northern Shrikes are present in the northern portions of the Loggerhead Shrike’s breeding range from September through March, when Loggerheads migrate south.
