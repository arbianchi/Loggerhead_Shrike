## Logging the Loggerhead (Shrike)

### Summary
There is only one [Shrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_shrike) native to North America and it is a surprisingly important part of the ecosystem. While they were once extremely common throughout the eastern US and Canada, no other bird species has seen their populations reduced as much since the 1960s. The Conservation Centers for Species Survival needs an application to serve as a central repository for researchers in Canada, the US and Mexico to log their research. How amazing would it be to be part of research that may prevent this amazing animal from going extinct?
